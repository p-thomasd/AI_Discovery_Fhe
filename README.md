# AI Discovery: The FHE-Powered AI Research Agent

AI Discovery is an innovative AI agent designed to accelerate scientific discovery by autonomously exploring vast, encrypted scientific databases, such as gene sequences and astronomical observations. At its core, this project leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology** to conduct secure pattern recognition and hypothesis generation without compromising sensitive data.

## The Challenge of Scientific Discovery

In today's fast-paced scientific landscape, researchers often grapple with the sheer volume of data available. Analyzing these expansive datasets manually is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Traditional methods may expose sensitive information, leading to privacy concerns and potential misuse. As a result, speeding up the discovery process while ensuring data confidentiality remains a significant challenge in fields like genetics and astronomy.

## How FHE Addresses the Problem

FHE provides an elegant solution to these challenges by allowing computations on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it. Utilizing **Zama's open-source libraries**, such as **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, or the **zama-fhe SDK**, AI Discovery can analyze complex datasets securely. This means the AI agent can autonomously identify patterns and generate hypotheses from encrypted data, thus preserving confidentiality while fostering groundbreaking scientific advancements.

## Core Functionalities

AI Discovery is packed with features that make it a revolutionary tool for researchers:

- 🔍 **Encrypted Data Analysis:** Analyze encrypted datasets for hidden patterns and relationships.
- 🤖 **Autonomous Hypothesis Generation:** Allow the AI to formulate hypotheses independently, enhancing the pace of scientific research.
- 🔗 **Compatibility with Various Data Formats:** Support for diverse scientific data formats, ensuring broad applicability across different domains.
- 📊 **Visualization of Discoveries:** Provide visual representations of new findings and insights generated by the AI, making it easier for researchers to interpret results.

## Underlying Technologies

The technology stack powering AI Discovery includes:

- **Zama's FHE Libraries** (Concrete, TFHE-rs, Zama-FHE SDK)
- **Node.js** for backend services
- **Hardhat** for Ethereum smart contract development
- **Solidity** for developing smart contracts
- **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** for machine learning models (optional, based on user preference)

## Installation Instructions

To set up AI Discovery on your local machine, follow these steps carefully:

1. **Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.**
2. Download the project files to your local environment (do not use `git clone`).
3. Navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to install dependencies, including the necessary Zama FHE libraries:

```bash
npm install
```

This will set up the environment with all required libraries to get AI Discovery up and running.

## Building and Running the Project

Now that you have installed all dependencies, you can compile, test, and run the project with the following commands:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts:**

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

2. **Run the Tests:**

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

3. **Start the Application:**

```bash
node src/index.js
```

In the provided code, you will find the essentials for how the AI agent interacts with encrypted data. Here's a brief code snippet to illustrate the primary functionality of hypothesis generation using FHE:

```javascript
const { FHE } = require('zama-fhe-sdk');
const encryptedData = FHE.loadEncryptedDataset('data/encrypted_scientific_data');

async function generateHypothesis(encryptedData) {
    const patterns = await FHE.analyzeData(encryptedData);
    return `Hypothesis: The presence of patterns ${patterns.join(', ')} suggests a new approach to study the phenomena.`;
}

generateHypothesis(encryptedData).then(console.log);
```
